# SFML Project
Basic project for learning, nothing special. 
You may need to install `SFML`, I recommend (this tutorial)[https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project].
You may also need to install `CMake` and `Make`, I am using those for build and compile. 
Project architecture based on my **CMake-Template** which you can find (here)[https://github.com/Cashtann/CMake-Template]
