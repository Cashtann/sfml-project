# SFML Project
### Basic project for learning, nothing special. 

Project architecture based on my **CMake-Template** which you can find [here](https://github.com/Cashtann/CMake-Template).

You may need to install `SFML`, I recommend [this tutorial](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project).

You may also need to install `CMake` and `Make`, I am using those for build and compile. 

I use (Linux) bash scripts to setup, build and run. If you want to use them too, you can see how [here](https://github.com/Cashtann/CMake-Template).
